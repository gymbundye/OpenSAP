# OpenSAP

I am creating this repository so as to have a place to do the Assignments
for the OpenSAP Python course I am taking. The program ended a couple of years ago 
but I think it has some great beginner material that could make me a better programmer.
They use an enviorment called CodeOcean which I do not have access to but I can make 
this repository and use Jupityer Notebook cells so I can work on them individually
without making a hundred repositories. If you are reading this thanks for checking out
my GITHUB and have a fantastic day.
